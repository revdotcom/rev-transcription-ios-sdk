    <p><strong>Fees:</strong> To use the Services, you will be required to make one or more payments and provide 
        Rev information regarding your credit card or other payment instrument. You represent and warrant to 
        Rev that such information is true and that you are authorized to use the payment instrument. You will 
        promptly update your account information with any changes (for example, a change in your billing address or 
        credit card expiration date) that may occur. You agree to pay Rev the amount that is specified in the 
        Service in accordance with the terms therein and this Terms of Service. Rev may choose to bill through 
        an invoice, in which case, full payment for invoices issued in any given month must be received by Rev 
        thirty (30) days after the mailing date of the invoice, or the Services may be suspended. Unpaid invoices are 
        subject to a finance charge of 1.5% per month on any outstanding balance, or the maximum permitted by law, 
        whichever is lower, plus all expenses of collection. If you dispute any charges you must let Rev know 
        within sixty (60) days after the date that Rev invoices you. We reserve the right to change 
        Rev's prices. If Rev does change prices, Rev will provide notice of the change on 
        the Site or in email to you, at Rev's option. Your continued use of the Service after the price change 
        becomes effective constitutes your agreement to pay the changed amount. You shall be responsible for all taxes 
        associated with Services other than U.S. taxes based on Rev's net income.</p>

        to comply with all local rules and laws regarding your use of the Service, including as it concerns online 
        conduct and acceptable content.</p>
    <p><strong>Commercial Use:</strong> Unless otherwise expressly authorized herein or in the Service, you agree not 
        to display, distribute, license, perform, publish, reproduce, duplicate, copy, create derivative works from, 
        modify, sell, resell, exploit, transfer or upload for any commercial purposes, any portion of the Service, use 
        of the Service, or access to the Service.</p>

    <h2>Intellectual Property Rights</h2>

        contain content or features (&quot;Service Content&quot;) that are protected by copyright, patent, trademark, 
        trade secret or other proprietary rights and laws. Except as expressly authorized by Rev, you agree 
        not to modify, copy, frame, scrape, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on the 
        Service or the Service Content, in whole or in part, except that the foregoing does not apply to your own User 
        Content (as defined below) that you legally upload to the Service. In connection with your use of the Service 
        you will not engage in or use any data mining, robots, scraping or similar data gathering or extraction 
        methods. Any use of the Service or the Service Content other than as specifically authorized herein is strictly 
        prohibited. The technology and software underlying the Service or distributed in connection therewith is the 
        property of Rev, our affiliates and our partners (the &quot;Software&quot;). You agree not to copy, 
        modify, create a derivative work of, reverse engineer, reverse assemble or otherwise attempt to discover any 
        source code, sell, assign, sublicense, or otherwise transfer any right in the Software. Any rights not 
        expressly granted herein are reserved by Rev.</p>
    <p>The Rev name and logos are trademarks and service marks of Rev (collectively the 
        &quot;Rev Trademarks&quot;). Other company, product, and service names and logos used and displayed 
        via the Service may be trademarks or service marks of their respective owners who may or may not endorse or be 
        affiliated with or connected to Rev. Nothing in this Terms of Service or the Service should be 
        construed as granting, by implication, estoppel, or otherwise, any license or right to use any of Rev 
        Trademarks displayed on the Service, without our prior written permission in each instance. All goodwill 
        generated from the use of Rev Trademarks will inure to our exclusive benefit.</p>
    <p><strong>Third Party Material:</strong> Under no circumstances will Rev be liable in any way for any 
        content or materials of any third parties (including users), including, but not limited to, for any errors or 
        omissions in any content, or for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any such 
        content. You acknowledge that Rev does not pre-screen content, but that Rev and its 
        designees will have the right (but not the obligation) in their sole discretion to refuse or remove any 
        content that is available via the Service. Without limiting the foregoing, Rev and its designees will 
        have the right to remove any content that violates these Terms of Service or is deemed by Rev, in its 
        sole discretion, to be otherwise objectionable. You agree that you must evaluate, and bear all risks associated 
        with, the use of any content, including any reliance on the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of such 
        content.</p>
    <p><strong>User Content Transmitted Through the Service:</strong> With respect to content or other materials you 
        upload through the Service or share with other users or recipients (collectively, &quot;User Content&quot;), 
        you represent and warrant that you own (or have sufficient rights to) all right, title and interest in and to 
        such User Content, including, without limitation, all copyright and rights of publicity contained therein. By 
        uploading any User Content you hereby grant and will grant Rev and its affiliated companies a 
        nonexclusive, worldwide, royalty free, fully paid up, transferable, sublicenseable, perpetual, irrevocable 
        license to copy, display, upload, perform, distribute, store, modify and otherwise use your User Content in 
        connection with the operation of the Service on your behalf, in any form, medium or technology now known or 
        later developed.</p>
    <p>You acknowledge and agree that any questions, comments, suggestions, ideas, feedback or other information about 
        the Service (&quot;Submissions&quot;), provided by you to Rev are non-confidential and Rev 
        will be entitled to the unrestricted use and dissemination of these Submissions for any purpose, commercial or 
        otherwise, without acknowledgment or compensation to you.</p>
    <p>You acknowledge and agree that Rev may preserve content and may also disclose content if required to do 
        so by law or in the good faith belief that such preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) 
        comply with legal process, applicable laws or government requests; (b) enforce these Terms of Service; (c) 
        respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third parties; or (d) protect the rights, property, 
        or personal safety of Rev, its users and the public. You understand that the technical processing and 
        transmission of the Service, including your content, may involve (a) transmissions over various networks; 
        and (b) changes to conform and adapt to technical requirements of connecting networks or devices.</p>
    <p><strong>Confidentiality:</strong>  Any documents or other text that you provide to Rev for the purpose 
        of providing the Services will be your &quot;Confidential Information,&quot; except to the extent such 
        documents (a) are known to Rev prior to receipt from you from a source other than one having an 
        obligation of confidentiality to you; (b) become known (independently of disclosure by you) to Rev 
        directly or indirectly from a source other than one having an obligation of confidentiality to you; or (c) 
        become publicly known or otherwise cease to be secret or confidential, except through a breach of this Section 
        by Rev. Rev will use the Confidential Information solely for the purpose of providing the 
        Services to you (the &quot;Permitted Purpose&quot;). Rev will not, without your prior consent, 
        disclose to any third party your Confidential Information, other than furnishing such Confidential Information 
        to our directors, officers, employees, agents, consultants, contractors, representatives or affiliated entities 
        (collectively, &quot;Associated Persons&quot;) who need to have access to such Confidential Information in 
        connection with the Permitted Purpose. Rev will use at least reasonable care to protect the 
        confidentiality of your Confidential Information. In the event that Rev is required by law to make any 
        disclosure of any of your Confidential Information, by subpoena, judicial or administrative order or otherwise, 
        Rev will use commercially reasonable efforts to give you notice of such requirement (to the extent 
        legally permissible) and will permit you to intervene in any relevant proceedings to protect your interests in 
        your Confidential Information.</p>
    <p><strong>Copyright Complaints:</strong> Rev respects the intellectual property of others, and we ask our 
        users to do the same. If you believe that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright 
        infringement, or that your intellectual property rights have been otherwise violated, you should notify 
        Rev of your infringement claim in accordance with the procedure set forth below.</p>
    <p>Rev will process and investigate notices of alleged infringement and will take appropriate actions 
        under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (&quot;DMCA&quot;) and other applicable intellectual property laws 
        with respect to any alleged or actual infringement. A notification of claimed copyright infringement should be 
        emailed to Rev's Copyright Agent at support@Rev.com (Subject line: &quot;DMCA Takedown 
        Request&quot;). You may also contact us by mail or facsimile at:</p>

    <address>Rev.com<br/>461 Bush St FL 4<br/>San Francisco, CA 94108<br/>415-449-3679</address>

    <p>To be effective, the notification must be in writing and contain the following information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>an electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright 
            or other intellectual property interest;</li>
        <li>a description of the copyrighted work or other intellectual property that you claim has been infringed;</li>
        <li>a description of where the material that you claim is infringing is located on the Service, with enough 
            detail that we may find it on the Service;</li>
        <li>your address, telephone number, and email address;</li>
        <li>a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the 
            copyright or intellectual property owner, its agent, or the law;</li>
        <li>a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your notice is accurate 
            and that you are the copyright or intellectual property owner or authorized to act on the copyright or 
            intellectual property owner's behalf.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Counter-Notice:</strong> If you believe that your User Content that was removed (or to which access was 
        disabled) is not infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's 
        agent, or pursuant to the law, to upload and use the content in your User Content, you may send a written 
        counter-notice containing the following information to the Copyright Agent:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>your physical or electronic signature;</li>
        <li>identification of the content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location 
            at which the content appeared before it was removed or disabled;</li>
        <li>a statement that you have a good faith belief that the content was removed or disabled as a result of 
            mistake or a misidentification of the content; and</li>
        <li>your name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address, a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction 
            of the federal court located within Northern District of California and a statement that you will accept 
            service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If a counter-notice is received by the Copyright Agent, Rev will send a copy of the counter-notice to 
        the original complaining party informing that person that it may replace the removed content or cease disabling 
        it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the content 
        provider, member or user, the removed content may be replaced, or access to it restored, in 10 to 14 business 
        days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at our sole discretion.</p>
    <p><strong>Repeat Infringer Policy:</strong> In accordance with the DMCA and other applicable law, Rev has 
        adopted a policy of terminating, in appropriate circumstances and at Rev's sole discretion, users who 
        are deemed to be repeat infringers. Rev may also at its sole discretion limit access to the Service 
        and/or terminate the memberships of any users who infringe any intellectual property rights of others, whether 
        or not there is any repeat infringement.</p>

    <h2>Third Party Websites</h2>
    <p>The Service may provide, or third parties may provide, links or other access to other sites and resources on the 
        Internet. Rev has no control over such sites and resources and Rev is not responsible for and 
        does not endorse such sites and resources. You further acknowledge and agree that Rev will not be 
        responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in 
        connection with use of or reliance on any content, events, goods or services available on or through any such 
        site or resource.  Any dealings you have with third parties found while using the Service are between you and 
        the third party, and you agree that Rev is not liable for any loss or claim that you may have against 
        any such third party.</p>

    <h2>Indemnity and Release</h2>
    <p>You agree to release, indemnify and hold Rev and its affiliates and their officers, employees, 
        directors and agent harmless from any from any and all losses, damages, expenses, including reasonable 
        attorneys' fees, rights, claims, actions of any kind and injury (including death) arising out of or relating to 
        your use of the Service, any User Content, your connection to the Service, your violation of these Terms of 
        Service or your violation of any rights of another. If you are a California resident, you waive California 
        Civil Code Section 1542, which says: &quot;A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does 
        not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have 
        materially affected his settlement with the debtor.&quot; If you are a resident of another jurisdiction, you 
        waive any comparable statute or doctrine.</p>

    <h2>Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; AND &quot;AS 
        AVAILABLE&quot; BASIS. Rev EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR 
        STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR 
        PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>
    <p>Rev MAKES NO WARRANTY THAT (I) THE SERVICE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, (II) THE SERVICE WILL BE 
        UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE, (III) THE RESULTS THAT MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE USE OF THE 
        SERVICE WILL BE ACCURATE OR RELIABLE, OR (IV) THE QUALITY OF ANY DOCUMENTS, PRODUCTS, SERVICES, INFORMATION, OR 
        OTHER MATERIAL PURCHASED OR OBTAINED BY YOU THROUGH THE SERVICE WILL MEET YOUR EXPECTATIONS.</p>

    <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT Rev WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, 
        CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS 
        OF GOODWILL, USE, DATA OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES (EVEN IF Rev HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF 
        SUCH DAMAGES), WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, RESULTING FROM: (I) 
        THE USE OR THE INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE; (II) THE COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS AND SERVICES 
        RESULTING FROM ANY GOODS, DATA, INFORMATION OR SERVICES PURCHASED OR OBTAINED OR MESSAGES RECEIVED OR 
        TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO THROUGH OR FROM THE SERVICE; (III) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR ALTERATION OF YOUR 
        TRANSMISSIONS OR DATA; (IV) STATEMENTS OR CONDUCT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE SERVICE; OR (V) ANY OTHER MATTER

        HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100).</p>
    <p>SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY 
        FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. ACCORDINGLY, SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS SET FORTH ABOVE MAY NOT 
        APPLY TO YOU. IF YOU ARE DISSATISFIED WITH ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICE OR WITH THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, YOUR SOLE 
        AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IS TO DISCONTINUE USE OF THE SERVICE.</p>

    <h2>Arbitration</h2>
    <p>At Rev's or your election, all disputes, claims, or controversies arising out of or relating to the 
        Terms of Service or the Service that are not resolved by mutual agreement may be resolved by binding 
        arbitration to be conducted before JAMS, or its successor. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, arbitration 
        will be held in San Francisco, California before a single arbitrator mutually agreed upon by the parties, or if 
        the parties cannot mutually agree, a single arbitrator appointed by JAMS, and will be conducted in accordance 
        with the rules and regulations promulgated by JAMS unless specifically modified in the Terms of Service. The 
        arbitration must commence within forty-five (45) days of the date on which a written demand for arbitration is 
        filed by either party. The arbitrator's decision and award will be made and delivered within sixty (60) days of 
        the conclusion of the arbitration and within six (6) months of the selection of the arbitrator. The arbitrator 
        will not have the power to award damages in excess of the limitation on actual compensatory, direct damages set 
        forth in the Terms of Service and may not multiply actual damages or award punitive damages or any other 
        damages that are specifically excluded under the Terms of Service, and each party hereby irrevocably waives any 
        claim to such damages. The arbitrator may, in his or her discretion, assess costs and expenses (including the 
        reasonable legal fees and expenses of the prevailing part) against any party to a proceeding. Any party 
        refusing to comply with an order of the arbitrators will be liable for costs and expenses, including attorneys' 
        fees, incurred by the other party in enforcing the award. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of 
        temporary or preliminary injunctive relief, any party may proceed in court without prior arbitration for the 
        purpose of avoiding immediate and irreparable harm. The provisions of this arbitration section will be 
        enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
    
    <h2>Termination</h2>
    <p>You agree that Rev, in its sole discretion, may suspend or terminate your account (or any part thereof) 
        or use of the Service and remove and discard any content within the Service, for any reason, including, without 
        limitation, for lack of use or if Rev believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the 
        letter or spirit of these Terms of Service. Any suspected fraudulent, abusive or illegal activity that may be 
        grounds for termination of your use of Service, may be referred to appropriate law enforcement authorities. 
        Rev may also in its sole discretion and at any time discontinue providing the Service, or any part 
        thereof, with or without notice. You agree that any termination of your access to the Service under any 
        provision of this Terms of Service may be effected without prior notice, and acknowledge and agree that 
        Rev may immediately deactivate or delete your account and all related information and files in your 
        account and/or bar any further access to such files or the Service. Further, you agree that Rev will 
        not be liable to you or any third-party for any termination of your access to the Service.</p>

    <h2>User Disputes</h2>
    <p>You agree that you are solely responsible for your interactions with any other user in connection with the 
        Service and Rev will have no liability or responsibility with respect thereto. Rev reserves 
        the right, but has no obligation, to become involved in any way with disputes between you and any other user of 
        the Service.</p>

    <h2>General</h2>
    <p>These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between you and Rev and govern your use of the 
        Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and Rev with respect to the Service. You also 
        may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use affiliate or third-party 
        services, third-party content or third-party software. These Terms of Service will be governed by the laws of 
        the State of California without regard to its conflict of law provisions. With respect to any disputes or 
        claims not subject to arbitration, as set forth above, you and Rev agree to submit to the personal and 
        exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within San Francisco County, California. The 
        failure of Rev to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service will not 
        constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms of Service is found by a court 
        of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give 
        effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms of 
        Service remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any 
        claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or these Terms of Service must be 
        filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. A printed version of 
        this agreement and of any notice given in electronic form will be admissible in judicial or administrative 
        proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as 
        other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. You may not assign 
        this Terms of Service without the prior written consent of Rev, but Rev may assign or 
        transfer this Terms of Service, in whole or in part, without restriction. The section titles in these Terms of 
        Service are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Notices to you may be made via either 
        email or regular mail. The Service may also provide notices to you of changes to these Terms of Service or 
        other matters by displaying notices or links to notices generally on the Service.</p>
